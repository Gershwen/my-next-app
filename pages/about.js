      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Gershwen and I have a passion for
        all things tech, especially writing code. As you will see below I have
        years of experience in sales and management however its during my years
        as a manager I discovered my true passion. As I have always been the
        go-to tech guy in the office. I then decided to change my career and
        follow the path im passionate about.
